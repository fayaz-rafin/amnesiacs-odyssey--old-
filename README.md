Amnesiac's Odyssey is a prototype Action/adventure game developed by me and my friend. The story is about a sailor who lost his memory and is trying to find out his origins and where he came from and the only way back home is to find the hidden treasure lost in this mysterious new world.

The game is currently in its early stages and we only have a concept ready so far.

## **Game Story**
The story is about our player trying to regain his memories as he finds himself stranded in a mysterious world. The only way to do so is to seek help from an old mysterious wizard on a distant island. The price, however, is to get him the treasure that lies within the archipelago and escort it back to him safely.

## Tech Stack
This game was coded using the C programming language, [GBDK C Compiler](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020), the GB Studio Game Engine and gbz80 Assembly based on the Zilog z80 procesor on the original Nintendo Gameboy and Gameboy Color. The sprites and all art asssets were created using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).
